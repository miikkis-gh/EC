excerpt: A look at how our team selects and tests every product before it makes it to the store.

Ever wondered how products end up on EC1? Our curation process is a blend of research, instinct, and rigorous testing. Here's a peek behind the curtain.

## Discovery

We're always on the lookout for emerging brands and independent makers. Trade shows, social media, word of mouth — our team casts a wide net to find products that stand out.

## Evaluation

Every product goes through a hands-on review. We test for quality, durability, and design. We ask: Does this solve a real problem? Would we use it ourselves? Does it meet our standards?

## The Final Selection

Only a fraction of the products we evaluate make it to the store. Our goal is a collection that feels intentional and cohesive — not an overwhelming marketplace of everything.
