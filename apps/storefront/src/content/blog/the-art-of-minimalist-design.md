excerpt: Why less is more when it comes to product design, and how simplicity enhances everyday life.

Minimalist design isn't about making things plain or boring — it's about finding the essence of what makes a product beautiful and functional, then removing everything else.

## Form Follows Function

The best minimalist products are those where every element serves a purpose. There's no decoration for decoration's sake. Each curve, edge, and material choice is intentional.

## The Power of White Space

In design, what you leave out is just as important as what you include. Negative space gives the eye room to rest and draws attention to the elements that matter most.

## Everyday Beauty

When products are thoughtfully designed, even everyday objects become sources of joy. A well-crafted mug, a perfectly balanced chair, a clean interface — these are the quiet pleasures of minimalist design.
