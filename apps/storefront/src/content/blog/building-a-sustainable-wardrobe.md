In a world of fast fashion and disposable goods, building a sustainable wardrobe is one of the most impactful choices you can make. It's not about having fewer clothes — it's about having the right ones.

## Start With the Basics

A sustainable wardrobe begins with versatile, high-quality staples. Think neutral colors that mix and match, durable fabrics that withstand regular wear, and timeless cuts that don't follow fleeting trends.

## Quality Over Quantity

Instead of buying five cheap t-shirts that fall apart after a few washes, invest in two or three that are well-made. The cost per wear drops significantly, and you'll reduce your environmental impact along the way.

## Care for What You Own

Extend the life of your clothes with proper care. Wash on cold, air dry when possible, and learn basic mending skills. A small repair can add years to a garment's life.
